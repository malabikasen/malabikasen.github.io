## My first blog on this page and what I want to do

Welcome to my blog! It's been a long time since I have poured my thoughts on the internet. I have been meaning to have a dedicated space on the internet to call a home for my thoughts and this looks like the perfect no-nonsense place for me.

A little introduction about me - 

Hello! My name is Malabika and I work as a Software Engineer. I have fun working on Backend Applications and debugging head-scratching production issues. I am a tinkerer and learn the best by doing.


If you are reading this in the future, 2023-2024 was probably the year people started taking AI very seriously. Atleast I did.
You could call me ignorant or too complacent with my current status as just a _Backend Software Engineer_ but couple of months ago is when I really started thinking if my current skills are indeed gonna stand the test of time...


With that fear, I did what I always do - I searched the internet for resources aka reddit threads to start learning AI.


Most of them pointed to [fast.ai](fast.ai) as the "best practical resource for coders" to learn AI. Like I said above, I learn the best by doing so this was a no-brainer for me.
I have been looking at the course and the first chapter for almost two weeks now but truth be told, I have not dipped my feet entirely.


May 14, 2024 i.e. today is the day I will kickstart my AI journey and blog about my learnings here.
I intend to dedicate an hour everyday to begin with and will update my progress for the day here. I also intend to host this space for folks who may want to start their AI journey in the future and need a dedicated resource.

My end goal is to transition to AI from plain vanilla Software Engineering so we will also see how that goes.

With that, I will head to do my [first lesson](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html) and will update the blog in a day!
